Welcome to the MLOps Engineering Book repository! This project hosts the source code and content for the MLOps Engineering Book, an online resource dedicated to MLOps practices, methodologies, and tools for efficiently deploying, managing, and scaling machine learning models.

## Introduction

MLOps, short for "Machine Learning Operations," is the practice of integrating machine learning models into the software development and deployment processes. This book aims to provide readers with a comprehensive guide to MLOps principles, best practices, and technologies that help streamline the lifecycle of machine learning projects.

The book covers a wide range of topics, including:

- Setting up a MLOps infrastructure and an ML platform
- Data management and versioning for ML projects
- Model training and evaluation
- Model deployment and monitoring
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for ML
- Kubernetes and containerization for ML
- And much more!

Whether you are a data scientist, machine learning engineer, or software developer, this book is designed to equip you with the knowledge and tools needed to implement MLOps effectively.

## Getting Started

To get started with the MLOps Engineering Book, you have two options:

1. **Read Online:** You can access the book online at [https://seblum.github.io/mlops-engineering-book/](https://seblum.github.io/mlops-engineering-book/). The website provides a user-friendly interface for easy navigation through chapters and sections.

2. **Build Locally:** If you prefer to read the book on your local machine or contribute to its development, you can build it using the [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) framework.

   Here are the steps to build the book locally:

   1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/seblum/mlops-engineering-book.git
      ```

   2. Install the required dependencies:

      ```bash
      # Assuming you have R and RStudio installed
      # Install the required R packages using RStudio or the following command:
      Rscript -e "install.packages(c('bookdown', 'rmarkdown'))"
      ```

   3. Navigate to the `book` directory:

      ```bash
      cd mlops-engineering-book/manuscript
      ```

   4. Build the book using Bookdown:

      ```bash
      # For HTML output
      Rscript -e "bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd', 'bookdown::gitbook')"

      # For PDF output (requires LaTeX)
      Rscript -e "bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd', 'bookdown::pdf_book')"
      ```

   5. Once the build process is complete, you can find the output files in the `_book` directory.
