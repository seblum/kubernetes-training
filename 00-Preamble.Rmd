# Preamble

This project started out of an interest in multiple domains. At first, I was working on a Kubeflow platform at the time and haven't had much experience in the realm of MLOps. I was starting with K8s and Terraform and was interested to dig deeper. I did so by teaching myself and I needed a project. What better also to do than to build "my own" MLOps plattform. I used Airflow since it is widely uses for workflow management and I also wanted to use it from the perspective of a data scientist, meaning to actually build some pipelines with it. This idea of extending the project to actually have a running use case expanded this work to include MLFlow for model tracking and DVC for data version control.

### A work in progress {-}

This project / book / tutorial / whatever this is or will be startet by explaining the concept of Kubernetes. The plan is to continuously update it by further sections. Since there is no deadline, there is no timeline, and I am also not sure whether there will exist something final to be honest.



### Preliminary Introduction

```
Introduction to a book about ML Engineering with airflow, and mlflow on an aws eks cluster deployed using terraform
```


"ML Engineering with Airflow and MLflow on AWS EKS: Building, Deploying, and Managing Machine Learning Workflows" is a comprehensive guide to building and deploying machine learning models using Airflow and MLflow on an AWS EKS cluster deployed using Terraform. The book is designed for data scientists and engineers who are looking to improve their machine learning workflows and automate the deployment of their models in a production environment.

The book begins by introducing the concepts of machine learning engineering and the challenges associated with building, deploying, and managing machine learning models. It then covers the basics of Airflow, a powerful tool for building and managing machine learning workflows, and MLflow, a platform for managing the machine learning lifecycle.

Next, the book covers the process of deploying an AWS EKS cluster using Terraform, a tool for provisioning and managing infrastructure as code. The book also covers the process of deploying Airflow and MLflow on the EKS cluster, as well as best practices for configuring and scaling the cluster.

The book goes on to cover the process of building machine learning workflows using Airflow, including data preprocessing, model training, and model deployment. It also covers the use of MLflow for tracking experiments, reproducing results, and deploying models in production.

Finally, the book covers advanced topics such as monitoring and troubleshooting machine learning workflows, and automating the management of machine learning models using Airflow and MLflow.

Overall, "ML Engineering with Airflow and MLflow on AWS EKS" is a valuable resource for data scientists and engineers looking to improve their machine learning workflows and automate the deployment of their models in a production environment.
