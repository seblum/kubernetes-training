# Introduction

## MLOps Engineering

Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) Engineering is the practice of applying software engineering principles and best practices to the deployment and management of machine learning models in a production environment. It is a discipline that combines the skills and expertise of data scientists, machine learning engineers, and DevOps engineers to ensure that machine learning models are deployed and managed efficiently and effectively.

The goal of MLOps engineering is to automate and streamline the process of building, testing, and deploying machine learning models, while also ensuring that they are performing as expected in production. This is achieved through the use of tools and technologies such as version control, continuous integration and delivery, and monitoring and observability.

By applying software engineering principles and best practices to the deployment and management of machine learning models, MLOps engineers can help organizations move quickly and efficiently from prototyping to production, while also ensuring that models are accurate and reliable.

## Machine Learning Operations

Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) is a practice that combines the collaboration and communication of data scientists and operations professionals to enable the efficient deployment and management of machine learning models in a production environment.

The goal of MLOps is to automate and streamline the process of building, testing, and deploying machine learning models, while also ensuring that they are performing as expected in production. This is achieved through the use of tools and best practices from software development and operations, such as version control, continuous integration and delivery, and monitoring and observability.

One of the key benefits of MLOps is that it allows organizations to move quickly and efficiently from prototyping to production, while also ensuring that models are accurate and reliable. This is especially important in industries such as finance, healthcare, and transportation, where the use of machine learning models can have a significant impact on business outcomes.

In this chapter, we will explore the key concepts and best practices of MLOps, including the role of data scientists and operations professionals, the importance of model governance, and the use of tools and technologies to support the MLOps process.

### ML + (Dev)-Ops

Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) and Development Operations (DevOps) are both practices that aim to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of software development and deployment. While the two practices share some similarities, there are also some key differences that set them apart.

DevOps is a practice that emphasizes the collaboration and communication between development and operations teams in order to improve the speed and quality of software delivery. The goal of DevOps is to automate and streamline the process of building, testing, and deploying software, while also ensuring that it is performing as expected in production. This is achieved through the use of tools and best practices from software development and operations, such as version control, continuous integration and delivery, and monitoring and observability.

DevOps focuses on the deployment and management of software in general, while MLOps focuses specifically on the deployment and management of machine learning models in a production environment. The goal is basically the same as in DevOps, yet deploying a machine learning model. While this is achieved by the same tools and best practices used in DevOps, deploying machine learning models (compared to software) adds a lot of complexity to the process.
Machine learning models are not just lines of code, but also require large amounts of data, and specialized hardware, to function properly. Further, their complex algorithms might need to change when there is a shift in new data. This process of ensuring that machine learning models are accurate and reliable lead to further challenges. Another key difference is that MLOps places a greater emphasis on model governance, which needs to ensure that machine learning models are compliant with relevant regulations and standards.


## Roles and Tasks in MLOps

The MLOps lifecycle typically involves several key roles and responsibilities, each with their own specific tasks and objectives.

##### Data Scientists
Data Scientists are usually responsible for developing and testing machine learning models within the development stage. Their work typically involves investigating large amounts of data, the necessary preprocessing steps, and choosing a suitable machine learning model that solves the business need. They further develop a functioning ML model respective to the data 
    
##### ML Engineers
ML Engineers work closely with Data Scientists to develop and deploy machine learning models in a production environment. They are responsible for creating and maintaining the infrastructure and tools needed to run machine learning models at scale and in production. 

They are also responsible for the day-to-day management and monitoring of machine learning models in a production environment. They use tools and technologies to track model performance and make sure that models are running smoothly and producing accurate results. This also includes to takes measures for data or model shifts (TODO: check data shift)

##### MLOps Engineer
The MLOps engineer is responsible for creating and maintaining the infrastructure and tools needed to run machine learning models at scale, and for ensuring that the models are integrated seamlessly into the overall software development and deployment process. This includes tasks such as setting up and configuring the necessary hardware and software environments, creating and maintaining documentation, and implementing automated testing and deployment processes. The MLOps engineer must be able to navigate this complexity and ensure that the models are deployed and managed in a way that is both efficient and effective. (TODO: check everything)
    
##### DevOps Engineers
DevOps Engineers are responsible for automating and streamlining the process of building, testing, and deploying software, or in this case machine learning models respectively. They use best practices from software development and operations, such as version control, continuous integration and delivery, and monitoring and observability, to ensure that models are performing as expected in production. 
    
##### Additional roles & function
The previous roles only show a small portion of all contributors within data projects. Additional roles are further mentioned to give an overview of the complexity of such interdisciplinary teams. Of course, every team differs and a team is not limited to these roles.

*Model Governance* is responsible for ensuring that machine learning models are accurate, reliable, and compliant with relevant regulations and standards. They typically work with data scientists, ML engineers, and other stakeholders to create and implement governance policies and procedures.

*Business stakeholders* are the end-users of the machine learning models and they are responsible for providing feedback and requirements for the models in the business context. They are also responsible for making decisions based on the results produced by the models.

It's also worth noting that some of these roles may overlap and different organizations may have different ways of structuring their teams and responsibilities. The most important thing is to have clear communication and collaboration between all the different teams, roles and stakeholders involved in the MLOps lifecycle.
