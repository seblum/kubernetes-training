## Machine Learning Workflow

A machine learning workflow typically involves several stages. These stages are closely related are sometimes overlap as some stages may involve multiple iterations. The stages are often handled by the same tool or platform a a clear differentiation across stages and tools is sometimes fairly difficult. Further, some machine learning workflows will not have all the steps or they might have some variations. In the following, the machine learning workflow is broken down to five different stages to make things easier and give an overview.

**1. Data Preparation**
In the first stage, the data used to train a machine learning model is collected, cleaned, and preprocessed . This includes tasks to remove missing or duplicate data, normalize data, and split the data into training and testing sets.
    
**2. Model Building** 
In the second stage, a machine learning model is selected and trained using the prepared data. This includes tasks such as selecting an appropriate algorithm, training the model, and tuning the model's parameters to improve its performance.
    
**3. Model Evaluation**
Afterward, the performance of the trained model is evaluated using the test data set. This includes tasks such as measuring the accuracy and other performance metrics, comparing the performance of different models, and identifying potential issues with the model.
    
**4. Model Deployment** 
Finally, the selected and optimized model is deployed to a production environment where it can be used to make predictions on new data. This stage includes tasks such as scaling the model to handle large amounts of data, and deploying the model to different environments to be used in different contexts
    
**5. Model Monitoring and Maintenance**
Once the model is deployed, it is important to monitor the model performance and update it as needed. This includes tasks such as collecting feedback, monitoring the model's performance metrics, and updating the model as necessary.

A machine learning workflow is thereby not a walk in the park. Being productive with machine learning, monitoring its performance and continuously retraining it on new data with possible alternative models can be challenging and involves the right tools.


### ML Worflow Tools

There are several machine learning workflow tools that can help streamline the process of building and deploying machine learning models. Integrating them into the machine learning workflow their functions can be distinguished into three processes. (1) *Workflow Management*, (2) *Model Tracking*, and (3) *Model Serving*. All three of these processes are closely related and are often handled by the same tool or platform.

#### Workflow Management

Workflow Management is the process of automating and streamlining the steps involved in building, training, and deploying machine learning models. This includes tasks such as data preprocessing, model training, and model deployment. Workflow management allows for the coordination of all the necessary steps in the ML pipeline, and the tracking of the pipelineâ€™s progress. 

Workflow management tools are used throughout the entire machine learning workflow. *Apache Airflow* is an open-source platform for workflow management and is widely used to automate the training and deployment of machine learning models.

#### Model Tracking

Model Tracking is the process of keeping track of the different versions of a machine learning model including tracking the performance of each version, the parameters used, and the data used to train it
Model Tracking tools are often used at the development and testing stages of the machine learning workflow. During development, tracking allows to keep track of the different versions of a model, compare their performance and learning parameters, and finally helps to select the best model version to deploy. Model tracking also allows to check the performance of a machine learning model during testing and assures it meets industry requirements.

*MLflow* is an open-source platform to manage the machine learning lifecycle, including experiment tracking, reproducibility, and deployment. Similarly, *DVC* (Data Version Control) is a tool that allows to version control, manage, and track not only models but also data.

#### Model Serving

Model Serving refers to the process of deploying a machine learning model in a production environment, so it can be used to make predictions on new data. This includes tasks such as scaling the model to handle large amounts of data, deploying the model to different environments, and monitoring the performance of the deployed model.

Model serving tools are specifically used at the deployment stage of the machine learning workflow. Model serving tools can handle the previous tasks such as deployment, scaling, and monitoring of a machine learning model.
Multiple tools integrate the funtionality of serving models, each different in its specific use cases, for example *TensorFlow*, *Kubernetes*, *DataRobot*, or also the already mentioned tools *MLflow* and *Airflow*


## Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)

Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) combines principles from machine learning development and operations to enable the efficient deployment and management of machine learning models in a production environment. The goal of MLOps is to automate and streamline the machine learning workflow as much as possible, while also ensuring that each machine learning model is performing as expected in production. 
Using MLOps principles allows organizations to move quickly and efficiently from prototyping to production.

The key concepts and best practices of MLOps, and the use of tools and technologies to support the MLOps process are closely related to *regular* DevOps principles, widely known in the industry of computer science.


### ML + (Dev)-Ops

Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) and Development Operations (DevOps) both aim to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of software development and deployment. Both practices share major similarities, but there are some key differences that set them apart.

The goal of DevOps is to automate and streamline the process of building, testing, and deploying software to make the management of the software lifecycle as quick and efficient as possible. This can be achieved by using tools, such as:

1.  *Containerization*: Tools such as Docker and Kubernetes are used to package and deploy applications and services in a consistent and reproducible manner.
2.  *Version Control*: Tools such as Git, SVN, and Mercurial are used to track and manage changes to code and configuration files, allowing teams to collaborate and roll back to previous versions if necessary.
3.  *Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)*: Tools such as Jenkins, Travis CI, and Github Actions are used to automate the building, testing, and deployment of code changes.
4.  *Monitoring and Logging*: Tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK are used to monitor the health and performance of applications and services, as well as to collect and analyze log data.
5.  *Cloud Management Platforms*: AWS, Azure, and GCP are used to provision, manage, and scale infrastructure and services in the cloud.

DevOps focuses on the deployment and management of software in general, while MLOps focuses specifically on the deployment and management of machine learning models in a production environment. The goal is basically the same as in DevOps, yet deploying machine learning model. While this is achieved by the same tools and best practices used in DevOps, deploying machine learning models (compared to software) adds a lot of complexity to the process.

Machine learning models are not just lines of code, but also require large amounts of data, and specialized hardware, to function properly. Further, their complex algorithms might need to change when there is a shift in new data. This process of ensuring that machine learning models are accurate and reliable lead to further challenges. Another key difference is that MLOps places a greater emphasis on model governance, which needs to ensure that machine learning models are compliant with relevant regulations and standards. The above list of tools within DevOps can be extended to the following for MLOps.

1.  *Machine Learning Platforms*: These platforms such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn are used to develop and train machine learning models.
2.  *Experiment Management Tools*: Tools such as MLflow, Weights & Biases, and Airflow are used to track, version, and reproduce experiments, as well as to manage the model lifecycle.
3.  *Model Deployment and Management Tools*: Tools such as TensorFlow Serving, Clipper, and Seldon Core are used to deploy and manage machine learning models in production.
4.  *Data Versioning and Management Tools*: Tools such as DVC, Data Version Control, and Pachyderm are used to version and manage the data used for training and evaluating models.    
5.  *Automated Model Evaluation and Deployment Tools*: Tools such as Kubeflow, AlgoTrader, and AlgoHub are used to automate the evaluation of machine learning models and deploy the best-performing models to production.

It's important to note that the specific tools used in MLOps and DevOps may vary depending on the organization's needs and some of the tools are used both but applied differently in each, e.g. container orchestration tools like Kubernetes. The above lists do also not claim to be complete.


### MLOps Engineering

MLOps Engineering is the discipline that applies the previously mentioned software engineering principles to create the needed development and production environment.
It usually comines the skills and expertise of data scientists, machine learning engineers, and DevOps engineers to ensure that machine learning models are deployed and managed efficiently and effectively.

<!--
TODO: Infrastructure
The MLOps engineer is responsible to create and maintain the infrastructure and tooling needed to train and deploy models, monitoring the performance of deployed models, and implementing processes for collaboration and version control. This includes tasks such as setting up and configuring the necessary hardware and software environments, creating and maintaining documentation, and implementing automated testing and deployment processes. The MLOps engineer must be able to navigate this complexity and ensure that the models are deployed and managed in a way that is both efficient and effective. (TODO: check everything)
-->

It is important to note that one person can not exceed on all of the above mentioned positions. Developing machine learning models into production usually requires multiple people working with different and specialized skillsets and roles.


## Roles and Tasks in MLOps

The MLOps lifecycle typically involves several key roles and responsibilities, each with their own specific tasks and objectives.

#### Data Scientist
Data Scientists are usually responsible for developing and testing machine learning models within the development stage. Their work typically involves investigating large amounts of data, the necessary preprocessing steps, and choosing a suitable machine learning model that solves the business need. They further develop a functioning ML model respective to the data 
    
#### ML Engineer
ML Engineers work closely with Data Scientists to develop and deploy machine learning models in a production environment. They are responsible for creating and maintaining the infrastructure and tools needed to run machine learning models at scale and in production. 

They are also responsible for the day-to-day management and monitoring of machine learning models in a production environment. They use tools and technologies to track model performance and make sure that models are running smoothly and producing accurate results. This also includes to takes measures for data or model shifts (TODO: check data shift)

#### MLOps Engineer
The MLOps engineer is responsible to create and maintain the infrastructure and tooling needed to train and deploy models, monitoring the performance of deployed models, and implementing processes for collaboration and version control. This includes tasks such as setting up and configuring the necessary hardware and software environments, creating and maintaining documentation, and implementing automated testing and deployment processes. The MLOps engineer must be able to navigate this complexity and ensure that the models are deployed and managed in a way that is both efficient and effective.
  
#### DevOps Engineer
DevOps Engineers are responsible for automating and streamlining the process of building, testing, and deploying software. They use best practices from software development and operations, such as version control, continuous integration and delivery, and monitoring and observability, to ensure that models are performing as expected in production. 
    
#### Additional roles & function
The previous roles only show a small portion of all contributors within data projects. Additional roles within an industry context might also include *Model Governance*, which is responsible to ensure that models are accurate, reliable, and compliant with relevant regulations and standards, or *Business stakeholders*, that provide feedback and requirements for the models in a business context.

It's also worth noting that some of these roles may overlap and different organizations may have different ways of structuring their teams and responsibilities. The most important thing is to have clear communication and collaboration between all the different teams, roles and stakeholders involved in the MLOps lifecycle.
