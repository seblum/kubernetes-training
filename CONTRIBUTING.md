# Contributing

I enthusiastically welcome any contributions. Whether it's spotting a typo, suggesting better sentence formulations, or proposing stylistic improvements, the initial step involves forking the repository. After making your changes, you can create a pull request.

If you're interested in making a more substantial contribution, such as writing a chapter or providing examples, I'd be thrilled! Please open an issue on GitHub, and we can discuss your ideas further.

Fork the repository and submit a pull request (PR) to propose your changes. You may use "[WIP]" in the PR title if you're still working on it.
