# Overview about book tutorials

The book contains two sections with distinct focuses. The first section comprises Chapters 3 to 6, which consist of tutorials on the specific tools aforementioned. These chapters also serve as prerequisites for the subsequent sections. Among these tutorials, the chapters dedicated to *Airflow* and *MLflow* are oriented towards Data Scientists, providing insights into their usage. The chapters centered around *Kubernetes* and *Terraform* target Data- and MLOps Engineers, offering detailed guidance on deploying and managing these tools.

The second section, comprising Chapters 7 to 9, delves into an exemplary ML Platform. This section demands a strong background in engineering due to its complexity. While these chapters cover the essential tools introduced in the previous section, they may not explore certain intricate aspects used like OAuth authentication and networking details in great depth. Moreover, it is crucial to note that the ML Platform example presented is not intended for production deployment, as there should be significant security concerns considered. Instead, its main purpose is to serve as an informative illustration of ML platforms and MLOps engineering principles.
