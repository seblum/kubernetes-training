## Machine Learning Workflow

A machine learning workflow typically involves several stages. These stages are closely related are sometimes overlap as some stages may involve multiple iterations. The stages are often handled by the same tool or platform a a clear differentiation across stages and tools is sometimes fairly difficult. Further, some machine learning workflows will not have all the steps or they might have some variations. In the following, the machine learning workflow is broken down to five different stages to make things easier and give an overview.

**1. Data Preparation**
In the first stage, the data used to train a machine learning model is collected, cleaned, and preprocessed . This includes tasks to remove missing or duplicate data, normalize data, and split the data into training and testing sets.
    
**2. Model Building** 
In the second stage, a machine learning model is selected and trained using the prepared data. This includes tasks such as selecting an appropriate algorithm, training the model, and tuning the model's parameters to improve its performance.
    
**3. Model Evaluation**
Afterward, the performance of the trained model is evaluated using the test data set. This includes tasks such as measuring the accuracy and other performance metrics, comparing the performance of different models, and identifying potential issues with the model.
    
**4. Model Deployment** 
Finally, the selected and optimized model is deployed to a production environment where it can be used to make predictions on new data. This stage includes tasks such as scaling the model to handle large amounts of data, and deploying the model to different environments to be used in different contexts
    
**5. Model Monitoring and Maintenance**
Once the model is deployed, it is important to monitor the model performance and update it as needed. This includes tasks such as collecting feedback, monitoring the model's performance metrics, and updating the model as necessary.

A machine learning workflow is thereby not a walk in the park. Being productive with machine learning, monitoring its performance and continuously retraining it on new data with possible alternative models can be challenging and involves the right tools.


### ML Worflow Tools

There are several machine learning workflow tools that can help streamline the process of building and deploying machine learning models. Integrating them into the machine learning workflow their functions can be distinguished into three processes. (1) *Workflow Management*, (2) *Model Tracking*, and (3) *Model Serving*. All three of these processes are closely related and are often handled by the same tool or platform.

#### Workflow Management

Workflow Management is the process of automating and streamlining the steps involved in building, training, and deploying machine learning models. This includes tasks such as data preprocessing, model training, and model deployment. Workflow management allows for the coordination of all the necessary steps in the ML pipeline, and the tracking of the pipelineâ€™s progress. 

Workflow management tools are used throughout the entire machine learning workflow. *Apache Airflow* is an open-source platform for workflow management and is widely used to automate the training and deployment of machine learning models.

#### Model Tracking

Model Tracking is the process of keeping track of the different versions of a machine learning model including tracking the performance of each version, the parameters used, and the data used to train it
Model Tracking tools are often used at the development and testing stages of the machine learning workflow. During development, tracking allows to keep track of the different versions of a model, compare their performance and learning parameters, and finally helps to select the best model version to deploy. Model tracking also allows to check the performance of a machine learning model during testing and assures it meets industry requirements.

*MLflow* is an open-source platform to manage the machine learning lifecycle, including experiment tracking, reproducibility, and deployment. Similarly, *DVC* (Data Version Control) is a tool that allows to version control, manage, and track not only models but also data.

#### Model Serving

Model Serving refers to the process of deploying a machine learning model in a production environment, so it can be used to make predictions on new data. This includes tasks such as scaling the model to handle large amounts of data, deploying the model to different environments, and monitoring the performance of the deployed model.

Model serving tools are specifically used at the deployment stage of the machine learning workflow. Model serving tools can handle the previous tasks such as deployment, scaling, and monitoring of a machine learning model.
Multiple tools integrate the funtionality of serving models, each different in its specific use cases, for example *TensorFlow*, *Kubernetes*, *DataRobot*, or also the already mentioned tools *MLflow* and *Airflow*
