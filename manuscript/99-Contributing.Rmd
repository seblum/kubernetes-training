Thank you for reading my book about MLOps Engineering. Please note that this book is an ongoing project, much like the evolution of software. It will undergo continuous refinement and thus improved over time and more chapters will be added.

I want to emphasize that all the text and code for this book are openly accessible on [GitHub](https://github.com/seblum/mlops-engineering-book). If you come across any errors or find something lacking within the book's content you are welcome to propose corrections, report issues, or make suggestions by [opening an issue](https://github.com/seblum/mlops-engineering-book/issues). Your contributions and insights are highly welcomed.
