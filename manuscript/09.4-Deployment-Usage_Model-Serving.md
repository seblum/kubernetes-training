## Model Serving & Inferencing

The process of serving and making inferences utilizes Docker containers and runs them within Kubernetes pods.

The concept involves running a Docker container that serves the pre-trained TensorFlow model using FastAPI. This containerized model is responsible for providing predictions and responses to incoming requests. Additionally, a Streamlit app is used to interact with the served model, enabling users to make inferences by sending input data to the model and receiving the corresponding predictions.


### Model Serving

The model serving application is built on FastAPI, which includes various endpoints catering to our use case. The primary endpoint, `predict`, allows for multiple predictions to be made, while additional maintenance endpoints such as `info` or `health` provide relevant information about the app itself.

To initiate the prediction process, the model is first retrieved from the MLflow registry. The specific model to be fetched and the location of the MLflow server are specified through environment variables. Once the model is loaded, it is used to generate predictions based on the provided input data. The API call returns the predictions in the form of a Python list.

```python


```

### Streamlit App

The Streamlit app offers a simple interface for performing inferences on the served model. The user interface enables users to upload a `jpg` image. Upon clicking the `predict` button, the image is sent to the model serving app, where a prediction is made. The prediction results are then returned as a JSON file, which can be downloaded upon request.

```python
