# Preamble {.unnumbered}

This project started out of an interest in multiple domains. At first, I was working on a Kubeflow platform at the time and haven't had much experience in the realm of MLOps. I was starting with K8s and Terraform and was interested to dig deeper. I did so by teaching myself and I needed a project. What better also to do than to build "my own" MLOps plattform. I used Airflow since it is widely uses for workflow management and I also wanted to use it from the perspective of a data scientist, meaning to actually build some pipelines with it. This idea of extending the project to actually have a running use case expanded this work to include MLFlow for model tracking.

### Topics {.unlisted .unnumbered}

The overall aim is to build and create a MLOps architecture based on Airflow running on AWS EKS. Ideally, this architecture is create using terraform. Model tracking might be done using MLFlow, Data tracking using DVC. Further mentioned might be best practices in software development, CI/CD, Docker, and pipelines. I might also include a small Data Science use case utilizing the Airflow Cluster we built.

### A work in progress {.unlisted .unnumbered}

This project / book / tutorial / whatever this is or will be, startet by explaining the concept of Kubernetes. The plan is to continuously update it by further sections. Since there is no deadline, there is no timeline, and I am also not sure whether there will exist something final to be honest.

This document is written during my journey in the realm of MLOps. It is therefore in a state of continuous development.
