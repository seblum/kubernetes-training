# Introduction

Imagine being able to effortlessly deploy, manage, and monitor your machine learning models with ease. No more headaches from version control issues, data drift, and model performance degradation. That's the power of MLOps. *"MLOps Engineering: Building, Deploying, and Managing Machine Learning Workflows with Airflow and MLflow on Kubernetes"* takes you on a journey through the principles, practices, and platforms of MLOps. You'll learn how to create an end-to-end pipeline for machine learning projects, using cutting-edge tools and techniques like Kubernetes, Terraform, and GitOps, and working with tools to ease your machine learning workflow such as Apache Airflow and MLflow Tracking. Before we begin, let's have a more closer look on what MLOps actually is, what principles it incorporates, and how it distinguished from traditional DevOps.

*"MLOps Engineering: Building, Deploying, and Managing Machine Learning Workflows with Airflow and MLflow on Kubernetes"* is a comprehensive guide to building and deploying machine learning models using Airflow and MLflow on an Kubernetes cluster running in a cloud environment. The Bookdown project is designed for Data Scientists, Data Engineers and DevOps practitioners who are looking to dive into the realm of machine learning operations (MLOps) and automate the deployment of their models in a production environment.

The Bookdown project begins by introducing the concepts of MLOps and the challenges associated with building, deploying, and managing machine learning models in production. It then covers the basics of *Airflow*, a powerful tool for building and managing machine learning workflows, and *MLflow*, a platform for managing the machine learning lifecycle.

Next, the book covers the basics of *Kubernetes*, an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications, and *Terraform*, a tool for provisioning and managing infrastructure as code. 

Finally, the book covers the process of deploying Airflow and MLflow on an Kubernetes cluster in a cloud environment using Terraform. Hencefore it introduces an exemplary implementation of the previously introduced tools. A machine learning workflow using Airflow is set up on the deployed infrastructure, including data preprocessing, model training, and model deployment, as well as tracking the experiment and deploying the model into production using MLFlow. 

Finally, the book covers advanced topics such as monitoring and troubleshooting machine learning workflows, and automating the management of machine learning models using Airflow and MLflow.

Finally, the book covers advanced topics such as implementing ML workflows in a CI/CD pipeline, and automating the management of machine learning models using Airflow and MLflow.
