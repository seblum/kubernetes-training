# Introduction

*"MLOps Engineering with Airflow and MLflow on Kubernetes: Building, Deploying, and Managing Machine Learning Workflows"* is a comprehensive guide to building and deploying machine learning models using Airflow and MLflow on an Kubernetes cluster running in a cloud environment. The book is designed for Data Scientists, Data Engineers and DevOps practitioners who are looking to dive into the realm of machine learning operations (MLOps) and automate the deployment of their models in a production environment.

The book begins by introducing the concepts of MLOps and the challenges associated with building, deploying, and managing machine learning models in production. It then covers the basics of *Airflow*, a powerful tool for building and managing machine learning workflows, and *MLflow*, a platform for managing the machine learning lifecycle.

Next, the book covers the basics of *Kubernetes*, an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications, and *Terraform*, a tool for provisioning and managing infrastructure as code. 

Finally, the book covers the process of deploying Airflow and MLflow on an Kubernetes cluster in a cloud environment using Terraform. Hencefore it introduces an exemplary implementation of the previously introduced tools. A machine learning workflow using Airflow is set up on the deployed infrastructure, including data preprocessing, model training, and model deployment, as well as tracking the experiment and deploying the model into production using MLFlow.

Finally, the book covers advanced topics such as monitoring and troubleshooting machine learning workflows, and automating the management of machine learning models using Airflow and MLflow.

Finally, the book covers advanced topics such as implementing ML workflows in a CI/CD pipeline, and automating the management of machine learning models using Airflow and MLflow.
