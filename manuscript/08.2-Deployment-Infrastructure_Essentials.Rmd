## Infrastructure

The subdirectory `infrastructure` consists of four main modules, `vpc`, `eks`, `networking`, and `rds`. The former three are responsible to create the cluster itself, as well as the necessary tools to implement the platform functionalities. The `rds` module is merely an extension linked to the cluster which is needed to store data of tools like Airflow or Mlflow. The `rds` module is thereby called in the corresponding modules where an AWS RDS is needed, even though the module is placed in the Infrastructure directory.
