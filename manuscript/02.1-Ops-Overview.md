might be an own chapters

DevOps is a set of practices and tools that aims to automate and streamline the software development and deployment process. The principles of DevOps include:

1.  Collaboration: DevOps promotes collaboration between development and operations teams to improve communication, increase efficiency, and reduce delays.
    
2.  Automation: DevOps uses automation tools and scripts to automate repetitive tasks, such as building, testing, and deploying software.
    
3.  Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD): DevOps uses CI/CD to automate the software development and deployment process. This includes automatically building, testing, and deploying code changes as soon as they are made.
    
4.  Monitoring and Logging: DevOps uses monitoring and logging tools to track the performance of deployed software and troubleshoot issues.
    
5.  Infrastructure as Code: DevOps uses tools to manage infrastructure as code, which allows for the automated provisioning, scaling, and management of infrastructure.
    
6.  Containers and Microservices: DevOps uses containers and microservices to package and deploy software, which allows for more flexibility and scalability.
    
7.  Test-Driven Development: DevOps uses Test-Driven Development (TDD) to ensure that the software is of high quality, it runs tests before and after any change to catch any errors early.
